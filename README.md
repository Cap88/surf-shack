# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a Bootstrap demo site for my passion for surfing.

* index.html is the home page with a large photo as a background.
* breaks.html contains a grid and a table.
* boards.html contains a grid an a list.
* contact.html is a sample contact form.
* The CSS is compiled with Sass.

PS: grids are ordered differently at a breakpoint.
